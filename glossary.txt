In the tab-delimited output file, each row represents all of the data for a
single gene.

SnpEff impact values represent structural impacts and are listed as the total
number of high (h), moderate (m), low (l), and modifier (x) classes for each
gene. For example, a value of mmx indicates there were two variants whose
highest impact was moderate and one variant whose highest impact was modifier.

Each gene-sample cell is shaded based on its impact, where the most damaging
impact class within the cell determines the shade. Darker shades correspond to
higher impacts.

For SnpEff, each gene is scored/ranked according to its overall impact across
samples. Lower rank implies greater impact.

For each gene-sample, dbNSFP impact values represent functional impacts and are
shown as the sum total of damaging indications for all 9 annotation sources.
For example, if a gene had two variants where variant A had 3 damaging votes
and variant B had 4 damaging votes, the value for that gene-sample would be
(4+3=) 7.

For dbNSFP, each gene is score/ranked according to its overall impact across
samples. Lower rank implies greater impact

COLUMN NAME	DESCRIPTION
gene_symbol:	Gene symbol
total_affected_samples:	Total number of samples at each gene
total_variant_loci:	Total number of distinct variants at each gene. A variant is
	defined as the unique set of [chromosome, position, ref, alt]
total_mutations: the sum total of all variants across all samples for this gene
dbNSFP_annotation|overall_damaging_rank:	Determined by the sum of the damaging votes
	across samples. Lower rank implies greater impact
dbNSFP_annotation|damaging_votes|<sample>:	Sum of all of the dbNSFP damaging votes for the
	sample
effect_annotation|overall_effect_rank:	Derived from the effect impact category, such that
	HIGH is weighted most and MODIFIER is weighted least. Lower rank implies
	greater impact
effect_annotation|effect|<sample>:	Aggregation of effect categories, where HIGH=h,
	MODERATE=m, LOW=l, and MODIFIER=x
effect_annotation|effect_category|<category>:	Sum count of each effect categories across
	samples
